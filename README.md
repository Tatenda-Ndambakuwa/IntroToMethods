This is practice for beginning java mentees.

PART 1:
Write a static void method called greeting with three String parameters that formats and prints the
date, one partner’s first and last name, and the other partner’s first and last name in the following
format:
blank line
Today is: <date>
We are <partner one first and last name> and <partner two first and last name>
blank line
  
PART 2:
1. Write a static value returning method called max that has two int parameters, num1 and
num2, and returns the larger of the two integers.
2. Write a static value returning method called abs that has five int parameters, num1, num2,
num3, num4, and num5 and returns the sum of the absolute value of each number.
3. These two methods will be called from within a print statement so the result can be printed to
the page.
